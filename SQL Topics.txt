//SQL---Resource W3Schools
SQL means Structured query Language.
SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases.
SQL is language used to communicate with the Database.
SQl is used to insert,update,remove the data in Database
Database is a collection of Table.
Tables contain rows and colums, each row called record.
Database is collection of data or information.
Oracle, Microsoft Access, Mysql, SQL Server are the various databases.
SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT
Each statement is seperated by a semicolon in SQL
*Every individual cell is called field which have infromation about record.
*Record is horizontal entity which have field. Table have records
*Column is a vertical entity of Table which have information.

//Using SQL in Your Web Site
To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:
*An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
*To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
*To use SQL to get the data you want
*To use HTML / CSS to style the page

//RDBMS
*RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
*RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.
*The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.

//Some of the important commands of SQL
SELECT - extracts data from a database
UPDATE - updates data in a database
DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index

//Selects all the records from Customers table
Eg: SELECT * FROM Customers;
Eg: SELECT CustomerName, City FROM Customers;--to select individual fields from table
*The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

//The SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement
*The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
Eg: SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
*SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;--to count distint coulmn fields and this cannot work in Microsoft Acess databases(Ex. firefox)

//The SQL WHERE Clause
*The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
*It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
*The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.
*In where statement text assigned in Quotes and number is in normal.
Eg: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Mexico';

//The SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators
*The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.
*AND displays record if both the conditions are true
*OR displays record if one of the condition is true
*NOT displays record if the condition is false
Eg: SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ...;
                                                 WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ...;
                                                 WHERE NOT condition;

Eg2: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Germany' AND City='Berlin';
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City='Berlin' OR City='München';
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE NOT Country='Germany';
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country='Germany' AND (City='Berlin' OR City='München');
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE NOT Country='Germany' AND NOT Country='USA';

//Operators in SQL
Operator	Description	Example
=	Equal	
>	Greater than	
<	Less than	
>=	Greater than or equal	
<=	Less than or equal	
<>	Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=	
BETWEEN	Between a certain range	
LIKE	Search for a pattern	
IN	To specify multiple possible values for a column

//The SQL ORDER BY Keyword
*The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.
*The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.
Eg: SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;
    SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Country DESC;
    SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Country, CustomerName;--here if country values are same then it orders by CustomerName
    SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;
   
//The SQL INSERT INTO Statement
*The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.
Eg: INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);--one way
    INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);---here columns are not mentioned and values are inserted according to the column number

Note:
*There will be autoincrement columns like IDs
*If some column values are not inserted against column names then those column fields take NULL values 

//SQL NULL Values
*A field with a NULL value is a field with no value.
*A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!
*NULL values are used to update or insert new record without adding any value
*IS NULL & IS NOT NULL is used to test the null values

Eg: SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL|IS NOT NULL;
    SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, Address FROM Customers WHERE Address IS NULL;
    
 //The SQL UPDATE Statement
 *The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.
 Eg: UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition;
     UPDATE Customers SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt' WHERE CustomerID = 1;
 *Update keyword must be used with where class otherwise all records are updated
 
 //The SQL DELETE Statement
 *The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.
 *If we wont specify where class all records are deleted.
 Eg: DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
     DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';
     DELETE FROM table_name;
     
//SQL TOP, LIMIT, FETCH FIRST or ROWNUM Clause
*The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.
*It is used on large number

MS Access & SQL Server
Ex: SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
    SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;
    
MYSQL
Ex: SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition LIMIT number;
    SELECT * FROM Customers LIMIT 3;
    
Oracle
Ex: SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name(s) FETCH FIRST number ROWS ONLY;
    SELECT * FROM Customers FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
    





Order  Server-->Database-->Table-->records.

*create the database

*In operator is used to print records which are present in table which are also in operator.

*In is a alternative for or operator.

*Between and not between operator(between 2 and 5----2,3,4,5).

* % and - are called as wildcards used with 'like' operator and are used to pull up the data. 

* % used after character for any character(b%) first letter b after any character.

* -b means first any single character seconf is b.

* --c%, -c-. 

*alter keyword is used to add column or modify any column.

*alter is used to change the table structure.

*add, update, drop used along with alter.

*update keyword is used to update the data inside the table.

*Order by is used to sort the table contents.

*Order by column desc used to get in descending order. 

*group by with aggregate used to do sum,max,min,avg ...like functions

*sum(month) is a aggregate function to calculate sum.

*Having is a keyword used for group results.

*where in group is used before grouping or making group with conditions.

*In subquery there must be one common column to match in both the table and we write queries regarding to that.

*Joins keyword is used to join the two tables with same column reference
select c.name, cl.location,c.age from citizen as c join citizenloc as cl on c.name=cl.name where location="canada";

Alter table table_name change old new int;

Joins--------->inner join--only matched items are formed
               Left Join--All left table values present and if right table values matches with left table then only values present otherwise it return NULL values 
               Right Join--All right table values present and if left table values matches with right table then only values present otherwise it return NULL values

*View is a virtual table created from parent table.

* As is used to rename the name column or alias names.

*delete is used to delete record.

*Is null is used to assign null

*union is used to select all the elements from the two tables but displays common values once.

*union all is used to select all the elements from the two tables.

*intersect is not a keyword used to select common elements using where in.

*Exists is a keyword used to select table if the selected record is present. 

*Case keyword is used to update the table with new values
*It contains when,then,else,end "newtable column".

*SQL Constraints decides what type of data to be allowed into the table.
*Constraints are NOTNULL,DEFAULT,UNIQUE,CHECK,PRIMARY KEY must be unique and notnull.

*Primary key is applied only for one record in a table and it is known as parent values.
*It cannot be NULL and duplicate.
*Foreign key in one table will refer to the primary of other table.
*Foreign key in one table check the presence of that key in primary of other table.
*Foreign key can be duplicate and can have NULL values, it can applied on multiple fields in a table
*primary key record cannot be deleted without deleting foreign key record but it is possible by ON DELETE CASCADE;
